        <h1>Introduction to Cyber Security</h1>
        <p class="muted">A clear, practical guide to the fundamentals of cyber security — threats, protections, careers, and how to begin learning today.</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>What is cyber security?</h2>
        <p>Cyber security is the practice of protecting computers, networks, programs, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. In a world where businesses, governments and individuals rely heavily on digital systems, cyber security ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability — the three pillars often abbreviated as CIA. Confidentiality means that sensitive information is seen only by those authorized to see it. Integrity ensures data remains accurate and unaltered. Availability guarantees that authorized users can access systems and information when needed.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why cyber security matters</h2>
        <p>Every organisation — from small startups to global enterprises — stores valuable digital assets. These include customer data, financial records, intellectual property, and operational systems. A single security breach can cause financial loss, reputational damage, regulatory fines, and operational disruption. For individuals, cyber threats can lead to identity theft, privacy invasions, or financial fraud. The rapid adoption of cloud services, remote work, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices has broadened the attack surface, making cyber security an essential and strategic priority.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Common types of cyber threats</h2>
        <p>Understanding common threats is the first step toward defending against them. The landscape constantly evolves, but several attack types remain prevalent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software such as viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Social engineering attacks that impersonate trusted entities to trick users into revealing credentials or clicking malicious links.</li>
          <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A form of malware that encrypts data and demands payment for the decryption key.</li>
          <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS):</strong> Attacks that overwhelm systems or networks with traffic, rendering services unavailable.</li>
          <li><strong>Insider Threats:</strong> Risk posed by employees, contractors, or partners who misuse access intentionally or accidentally.</li>
          <li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Targeting software or service providers to compromise multiple downstream victims.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Core defensive strategies</h2>
        <p>Effective cyber security blends technology, processes, and people. Here are foundational defensive measures every organisation should consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Access control and least privilege:</strong> Grant users only the permissions they require. Regularly review access rights.</li>
          <li><strong>Strong authentication:</strong> Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to reduce risk from stolen credentials.</li>
          <li><strong>Patch management:</strong> Apply security updates promptly to close known vulnerabilities in software and systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Protect data at rest and in transit using modern encryption standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Network segmentation:</strong> Limit lateral movement by separating critical systems from general user networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Endpoint protection:</strong> Deploy antivirus/EDR solutions and configure devices securely.</li>
          <li><strong>Backup and recovery:</strong> Maintain reliable backups and test restoration procedures regularly — vital for resilience against ransomware.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Security operations and incident response</h2>
        <p>Even with strong defenses, incidents can occur. A mature cyber security program includes an incident response plan, security monitoring, and forensic capability. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) monitor networks and endpoints for abnormal activity, triage alerts, and coordinate responses. An incident response plan outlines roles, communication pathways, containment steps, and recovery actions. The faster an organization detects and responds to a breach, the lower the potential damage.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Essential tools and technologies</h2>
        <p>Cyber security professionals use a broad toolkit. Here are some commonly used types of tools:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Firewalls and VPNs</strong> — protect network perimeters and secure remote connections.</li>
          <li><strong>Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)</strong> — identify and stop suspicious traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)</strong> — detect and contain threats on devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</strong> — aggregate and analyze logs for threat detection.</li>
          <li><strong>Vulnerability scanners</strong> — find potential weaknesses in systems and applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Penetration testing tools</strong> — simulate attacks to evaluate defenses.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Principles of secure design</h2>
        <p>Security should be built in, not bolted on. Secure design principles help create resilient systems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Defense in depth:</strong> Layer multiple security controls so that if one fails others still protect the system.</li>
          <li><strong>Fail-safe defaults:</strong> Systems should default to secure settings rather than permissive ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Complex systems are harder to secure and maintain.</li>
          <li><strong>Audit and logging:</strong> Maintain detailed logs for visibility and forensic investigation.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Careers in cyber security</h2>
        <p>The field offers diverse career paths that match different interests and skill sets. Popular roles include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Security analyst:</strong> Monitors alerts, investigates incidents, and tunes detection rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Penetration tester/ethical hacker:</strong> Simulates attacks to identify vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Security engineer/architect:</strong> Designs and implements security controls and infrastructure.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident responder/forensics specialist:</strong> Leads investigations after a security event.</li>
